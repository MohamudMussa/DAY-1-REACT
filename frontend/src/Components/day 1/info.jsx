        <h5 > I’ve always been deeply interested in IT, 
        constantly keeping myself up to date with new technologies 
        and how they affect the world that we live in. I studied 
        Computer Science in both A levels and University. This gave me 
        a stronger understand & foundation to build off on. I then 
        secured a role as a Software Analyst where I gained analytical 
        skills to solve problems and also became familiar with Agile,
        ITIL, and other best practice frameworks. Working closely with 
        developers and clients, I gained the ability to communicate in 
        both technical and non-technical formats. However, this didn’t 
        fulfil my creative hunger. I’ve since been focusing on gaining 
        and solidifying my programming skills in order to solve 
        problems and to also create things that I think of. </h5>
